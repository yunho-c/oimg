# Windows CI/CD Setup

One-time setup required before the GitHub Windows release workflow can build ZIP releases, Inno Setup installers, and Microsoft Store MSIX packages.

## GitHub Secrets

Add this secret in GitHub under **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets**.

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_REPO_TOKEN` | GitHub token with read access to `yunho-c/slimg`, `yunho-c/tjdistler-iqa-fork`, and `yunho-c/irondash`. |
| `WINGETCREATE_TOKEN` | GitHub token used by `wingetcreate` to open update PRs against `microsoft/winget-pkgs`. |

## GitHub Token

Create a fine-grained personal access token that can read the sibling repositories:

- `yunho-c/slimg`
- `yunho-c/tjdistler-iqa-fork`
- `yunho-c/irondash`

Give it read-only repository contents access, then save it as `CI_REPO_TOKEN`.

Create a second token for WinGet submissions and save it as `WINGETCREATE_TOKEN`. It must be able to fork and open pull requests against `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.

## Build Environment

The workflow runs on GitHub-hosted Windows and installs the native tools needed by the Windows build:

- Flutter stable
- Rust `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
- NASM
- LLVM
- Inno Setup 6.3 or newer

The workflow uses `scripts/windows/build_windows.ps1` so Rust and Cargokit use the x64 MSVC toolchain consistently.

The workflow uses Inno Setup to package the existing release build as a per-user x64-compatible installer. The installer creates a Start Menu shortcut, offers an optional desktop shortcut, and registers OIMG in Windows Open with for supported image files.

For local installer packaging after a release build, run:

```powershell
just windows-installer
```

The workflow then uses `dart run msix:create` to package the existing release build for Microsoft Store submission. The MSIX package is intentionally unsigned because Microsoft Store signs packages after submission.

## WinGet Publishing

The `Windows WinGet Publish` workflow runs when a GitHub Release is published. It uses the public Inno Setup installer asset from that release and submits a WinGet manifest update for package ID `YunhoCho.OIMG`.

The installer URL is derived from the tag:

```text
https://github.com/yunho-c/oimg/releases/download/v<version>/OIMG-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe
```

One-time setup:

1. Publish the first Windows release with the setup EXE asset.
2. Run `wingetcreate new` locally for that setup EXE URL.
3. Use package ID `YunhoCho.OIMG`.
4. Use installer type `inno`.
5. Submit the generated manifest PR and wait for it to merge into `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.

After the package exists in WinGet, future published GitHub Releases should trigger the workflow and open update PRs automatically.

For a manual dry run, dispatch `Windows WinGet Publish` with `submit` set to `false`. To manually open a WinGet PR for an existing published release, dispatch it with `submit` set to `true`.

## Release Workflow

The workflow runs for tags named `v*` and can also be retried manually from the GitHub Actions UI.

Normal release flow:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
```

Update `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1.0.1+2
```

Run local checks:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test test/settings test/file_open_controller_test.dart test/file_open_channel_test.dart test/optimization
env RUSTC_WRAPPER= CARGO_BUILD_RUSTC_WRAPPER= cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml
```

Commit and tag:

```bash
git add pubspec.yaml pubspec.lock
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.1"
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin main v1.0.1
```

The tag version must match the public version in `pubspec.yaml`. For example, `v1.0.1` matches `version: 1.0.1+2`.

## After the Workflow Finishes

The workflow creates a draft GitHub Release and attaches:

- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64.zip`
- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64.zip.sha256`
- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`
- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe.sha256`
- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64.msix`
- `OIMG-<version>-windows-x64.msix.sha256`

Before publishing the draft:

1. Download the ZIP, setup EXE, and MSIX from the draft release.
2. Extract the ZIP on Windows.
3. Launch `oimg.exe`.
4. Run the setup EXE.
5. Launch OIMG from the Start Menu.
6. Confirm any SmartScreen warning is only the expected unsigned-app warning.
7. Open an image from OIMG.
8. Use Windows Open with on an image file.
9. Uninstall OIMG from Windows Settings.
10. Run a basic optimization.
11. Submit the MSIX to Microsoft Store.
12. Publish the GitHub Release when the ZIP, installer, and Store package look correct.
13. Confirm the WinGet workflow opens or updates a PR for `YunhoCho.OIMG`.

## Microsoft Store

The MSIX configuration uses the Partner Center identity for OIMG:

- Publisher display name: `Yunho Cho`
- Identity name: `YunhoCho.OIMG`
- Publisher: `CN=5FD6739C-65DE-4602-8C56-90200FC1D6DC`

The MSIX manifest declares the same supported image file extensions as the native Windows runner.

The workflow passes the release tag version to MSIX as `<version>.0`. For example, tag `v1.0.1` becomes MSIX version `1.0.1.0`.

## Future Signing

The Windows ZIP and setup EXE are unsigned until a code-signing certificate is available in CI. The Microsoft Store MSIX is also unsigned before submission because Store distribution signs the package.

When signing is added, the workflow should:

- Import the certificate into a temporary CI certificate store.
- Sign `oimg.exe` and bundled DLLs before packaging.
- Sign the setup EXE after Inno Setup packaging.
- Verify signatures before uploading artifacts.

Expected future secrets:

- `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PFX_BASE64`
- `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`

## Notes

- The workflow currently checks out sibling repos from the branches used by this app: `slimg` from `main`, `tjdistler-iqa-fork` from `perf/simd-gaussian-vertical`, and `irondash` from `fix/macos-engine-context-race`.
- For more reproducible releases, later pin those sibling checkouts to tags or commit SHAs.
- The workflow uses GitHub-hosted `windows-2025`; update that runner deliberately when changing the Windows build environment.
